The Data is Deceptive

I made this visualization to communicate my realization that the NYT article search yields more word search hits with time, regardless of what the search term is. In this way, this data set is not necessarily a good measure of relationships or import of these words. For example, this data set could be used to examine the seemingly 1 to 1 relationship between the prevalence of the words "immigration" and "disease", but when paired with "shoe" data, the data sets become innocuous. The instance of most words has increased over time.
